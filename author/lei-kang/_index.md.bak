I am a fourth-year industrial PhD student in [Pattern Recognition and Document Analysis Group](http://dag.cvc.uab.es/) at [Computer Vision Center](http://www.cvc.uab.es/) and research group at [omni:us](https://omnius.com/). I am advised by [Marçal Rusiñol](http://www.cvc.uab.es/~marcal/), [Alicia Fornés](http://www.cvc.uab.es/~afornes/) and [Mauricio Villegas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=18e7rpsAAAAJ). My research topics are based on handwritten document analysis, specifically, sequence-to-sequence based approaches for handwriting recognition, multi-writer adaptation, language modelling, GANs-based handwriting generation, etc.
